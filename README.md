# Project Title

Text Processing Project: Sentiment analysis of skincare products with simple predictive models using Gaussian Naive Bayes and Multinomial Naive Bayes.

This project was made on 22/12/2023 as the final project of my Text Processing course in semester 3.

## the Process
The pre-processing that is done is lower casing, normalization of the 
labels, duplication correction, removing special characters and punctuation, normalizing whitespace, removing stopwords, lemmatization, and stemming. 

With the clean data, we perform feature extraction with tf-idf and word2vec,

then the results of our extraction are trained using the naive bayes algorithm.
